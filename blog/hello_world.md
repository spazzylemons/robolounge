[A certain dhole suggested that more furries write blogs.](https://furry.engineer/@soatok/109936791707216276)
I have been thinking about starting a blog. So this was some good motivation to
get started with. Plus, I wanted to organize my website since it's just been a
single page for a while and a rather disorganized one at that. (You should
[check out his blog too!](https://soatok.blog/))

I'll see how long I can keep this up since

1. I don't write much
2. I'm quick to abandon projects
3. I don't have much to write about

but it's worth a shot. Expect rants about programming, gamedev, and maybe some
furry stuff. If you're interested, subscribe to my RSS feed! Tomorrow, I'll
begin the [7DRL](https://7drl.com/), and I'll write about my progress
(hopefully) every day.
